      - Hello,
      - The electrical grid is one of the most complex systems built by humans, and I'd like to help make it more resilient. As we electrify our transport and industries in order to reduce emissions, being able to protect and grow the grid to meet the world's increasing demand for electricity will become ever important. However, adding sensors onto existing power lines to monitor them is difficult without jeopardizing service, and such sensors do not always paint the full picture of the fault or what caused it. Sometimes, like a lineman, you have to be there to see what occurred and how it affects customers' electricity supply.
      - That's why I believe Gridware's devices have an advantage, to be able to quickly determine when a fault occurs using data from multiple sensors (imagery, vibration), and clearly communicate what happened to the utility. From years of experience as an engineer at BluWave-ai and working on personal projects, with a degree in mechatronic systems engineering, I understand how important the grid is, how to quickly process massive amounts of data from multiple sources, and how to maintain sensors that provide the data we often take for granted. In my experience developing an IoT-integrated hydroponic farm, for example, I built a remote SCADA system starting from the ground up, beginning with a suite of sensors at the hardware level (including streaming imagery) and ending with a Grafana dashboard for high-level monitoring. Furthermore, at Jastram Engineering, I implemented the hardware and developed the software for sensing and analyzing vibration patterns for hydraulic power units, which I believe is not entirely dissimilar to how the AGR platform helps detect faults.
      - Overall, I have experience maintaining and monitoring suites of sensors—and developing software for remote devices to communicate with such sensors—that would make me a valuable team member. I'd be honored to work on Gridware's team tackling one of the world's most important problems.
      - Looking forward to hearing from you,
      - Keegan Green
