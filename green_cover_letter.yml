      - Hello, team at Overstory!
      - The electrical grid is one of the most complex systems build by humans, and I'd like to help make it more resilient. As we electrify our transport and industries in order to reduce emissions, being able to protect and grow the grid to meet the world's increasing demand for electricity will become ever important. Furthermore, in less privileged parts of the world where the grid is less reliable, making it easier and more cost effective to maintain is a strong approach to make electricity more accessible. For these purposes, I have a huge amount of respect for what Overstory is doing.
      - I have an extensive background in using machine learning to solve grid-related problems. Among my professional experience is the development of a novel and more accurate type of predictor for electrical load, which was put into the hands of utilities in Mumbai and Prince Edward Island to make better energy purchasing decisions. A great deal of my work at BluWave-ai has sought to better model the grid, and to develop creative solutions that tackle challenges posed to the it&mdash;whether by optimally scheduling EV charging en mass, or by dispatching grid-scale batteries. These solutions required writing great quality production code and pipelines to efficiently process data and determine how best to protect the grid. I'd love to bring my expertise doing this to Overstory.
      - While I think you'll agree that my résumé is not a verbatim match to the job description (when is it?), I have much to offer Overstory. Central to my experience is the ability to efficiently derive answers from enormous datasets&mdash;geospacial data among them&mdash;and make the grid more reliable using ML. Evident by my portfolio of personal projects is an attitude that is devoted to gaining a deep understanding of how things work, where problems exist, and how they can be solved, particularly in the sustainability space.
      - While improving estimates of vegetation and its effect on grid operators is an extremely difficult task, I would be an asset on your team tacking that problem and am up for the challenge!
      - Looking forward to hearing from you,
      - Keegan Green
