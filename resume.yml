# Personal Summary: I'm an SFU systems engineering graduate and a software engineer with four years of experience bringing software solutions from conception to deployment in the smart grid and EV fleet spaces. I've created multiple software systems for controlling and interfacing with physical hardware such as EVs and power grid technology – and, in the process, honed my ability to develop reusable, well-tested, and fast software. I always bring initiative and passion as a team member. And, as can be determined from my personal projects, I enjoy tackling problems with programming.
