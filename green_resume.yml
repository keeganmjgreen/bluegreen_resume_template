          - ? Created, evaluated, and deployed novel load predictors for Prince Edward Island and Mumbai, which outperformed the baseline by 17%
            : - By helping utilities purchase green energy in advance, this is a tool for reducing emissions
          - Created a data ingestion pipeline to get hourly updates on how much power Prince Edward Island is consuming and generating from wind and solar, to feed ML inference
          - ? Developed and deployed an optimization service to reduce strain on the electrical grid by controlling grid-scale batteries and hundreds of EVs, for an ongoing EV Everywhere program with Hydro Ottawa
            : - Created an algorithm that controls EVs&rsquo; charging to consume power when the energy mix is green
          - Developed and deployed software to optimally control a solar-powered hydrogen production and storage system, extending its component lifespan while generating electricity from green hydrogen at high-demand times
          - ? Collaboratively developed, and deployed, a cloud service that sends timely and helpful charging station recommendations to EV taxi drivers based on location
            : - Helped progress the pilot project with the taxi company to the next stage by using GeoPandas to create a real-time simulator of EV taxi fleet operations that was showcased at <a href="https://www.cop28.com/en/">COP28</a>
              - Made an interactive tool using Plotly, OpenStreetMap, and the Google Maps API to help automate the process of finding and categorizing charging stations
          - ? Developed and deployed prototype optimizers of electric bus charging operations for multiple transit agencies in simulation
            : - Created optimization models for peak energy use and energy cost minimization in a model predictive control scheme, used in a simulation study for many Ontario school bus depots
          - Created a library used by multiple projects for testing smart grid control software in a variety of simulated environments
          - Co-inventor on <a href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Keegan+Michael+John+GREEN">five patents</a>, including for the real-time, data-driven minimization of cost and greenhouse gas emissions with EV charging stations
